# Why Request This Grant
There is considerable room for enhancing liquidity in NFT trading, particularly for token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-404 (fungible / non-fungible token standards) on Arbitrum and the many upcoming Orbit chains. 

Scattering's mission is to assist Arbitrum NFT users in enhancing liquidity by enabling instant NFT trading, similar to the experience of trading ERC-20 tokens.

Scattering has currently been fully bootstrapped so far, with the goal of achieving as close to a fair launch as possible. Therefore, we hope to get grant support from the Arbitrum Foundation to help us cover some development costs and incentives for the future adoption.

# Project Overview
Scattering is a protocol engineered to enhance liquidity and accessibility in the NFT market on Arbitrum. It empowers NFT owners to secure their assets in a unique Safebox, receiving sTokens and a Key that represent their NFT's value. 

Scattering bifurcates the floor price and uniqueness value of NFT collections, fostering distinct trading markets. 

It also serves as the pioneering marketplace for ERC-404 tokens on Arbitrum, seamlessly integrating ERC-404 token trading with NFT transactions. For those users who enjoy the more traditional NFT trading experience, Scattering will also support regular buying, selling, bidding and sweeping of ERC-721 assets. 


**Core Values**

- NFT holders have the ability to sell their NFTs instantly or hedge against future risks. 
- NFT investors can acquire sTokens, gaining exposure to their preferred NFTs without purchasing the full assets. 
- NFT traders experience the convenience of seamlessly swapping between different collections. 
- ERC-404 traders engage in the trading of ERC-404 tokens and their NFT counterparts through a user-friendly interface.
